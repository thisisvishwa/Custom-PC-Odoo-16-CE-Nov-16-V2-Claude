# Translation Contributions

We appreciate the efforts of our community in making our Custom PC Building Module accessible to users worldwide. If you're interested in contributing translations, here's how you can help:

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for an account on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/).
2. Join our translation group at [Custom PC Building Module Translations](https://launchpad.net/~custom-pc-building-module-translations).

## Translation Guidelines

- Ensure that your translations are accurate and contextually correct.
- Avoid direct word-for-word translations. Try to capture the essence of the message.
- Keep in mind the technical nature of the module. Some terms may not have a direct translation in your language. In such cases, use the commonly accepted term in your language.
- Be consistent with the terminology used. If a term has been translated in a certain way in other parts of the module, continue using the same translation.

## Submitting Translations

1. Choose the language you want to translate to.
2. Download the .po file for that language.
3. Open the .po file in a PO editor like Poedit.
4. Translate the strings in the .po file.
5. Save your changes and upload the .po file back to Launchpad.

## Review Process

Once you submit your translations, they will be reviewed by our team for accuracy and adherence to the guidelines. Approved translations will be included in the next release of the module.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Your efforts help us make the Custom PC Building Module more accessible to users around the world.
